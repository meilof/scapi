/**
 * A concrete class for Malicious OT extension receiver. <P>
 * 
 * The base OT is done once in the construction time. After that, the transfer function will be always optimized and fast, no matter how much OT's there are.<p>
 * 
 * There are three versions of OT extension: General, Correlated and Random. The difference between them is the way of getting the inputs: <p>
 * In general OT extension both x0 and x1 are given by the user.<p>
 * In Correlated OT extension the user gives a delta array and x0, x1 arrays are chosen such that x0 = delta^x1.<p>
 * In random OT extension both x0 and x1 are chosen randomly.<p>
 * To allow the user decide which OT extension's version he wants, each option has a corresponding input class. <p>
 * The particular OT extension version is executed according to the given input instance; 
 * For example, if the user gave as input an instance of OTExtensionRandomRInput than the random OT Extension will be execute.<p>
 * 
 * NOTE: Unlike a regular implementation, the connection is done via the native code and thus the channel provided in the transfer function is ignored.
