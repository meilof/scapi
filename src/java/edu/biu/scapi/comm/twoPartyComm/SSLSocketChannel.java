 * This class represents a concrete channel in the Decorator Pattern used to create Channels. This channel ensures using of SSL communication.<P>
 * In order to enforce the right usage of the Channel class we will restrict the ability to instantiate one, 
 * only to classes within the Two party Communication Layer's package. This means that the constructor of the channel will be 
 * unreachable from another package. However, the send, receive and close functions will be declared public, therefore 
 * allowing anyone holding a channel to be able to use them.<p>
 *  
 * This class derives the {@link PlainTCPSocketChannel} since the functionality is identical to the regular channel except the creation of the socket that here is an ssl socket.
 * The creation of the socket is done using the {@link SSLSocketFactory} that is given in the constructors of the class.
