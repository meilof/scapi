 * This class represents a concrete channel in the Decorator Pattern used to create Channels. This channel ensures TCP 
 * type of communication.
 * In order to enforce the right usage of the Channel class we will restrict the ability to instantiate one, 
 * only to classes within the Two Party Communication Layer's package. This means that the constructor of the channel will be 
 * unreachable from another package. However, the send, receive and close functions will be declared public, therefore 
 * allowing anyone holding a channel to be able to use them.
 *  
 * The difference between this implementation to the {@link PlainTCPChannel} is that here there are two sockets: 
 * one used to receive messages and one used to send messages. The other {@link PlainTCPChannel} has one socket used 
 * both to send and receive.
