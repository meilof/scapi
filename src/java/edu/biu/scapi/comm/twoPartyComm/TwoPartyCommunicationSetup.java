/** 
 * The TwoPartyCommunicationSetup interface manages the common functionality of all two party communications. 
 * There are several ways to communicate between two parties - using sockets, queues, etc. Each concrete way should implements this 
 * interface and the functions in it.<p>
 * This interface should be used in the specific case of communication between two parties, while CommunicationSetup should be used in
 * the extended case of multi-party communication.<p>
 * 
 * The Communications Layer package is a tool used by a client that is interested in setting up connections 
 * between itself and other party. As such, this layer does not initiate any independent tasks, but the opposite. Given two parties, 
 * it attempts to set connections to them according to parameters given by the calling application. If succeeds, it returns these 
 * connections so that the calling client can send and receive data over them.<p>
 * Note that multiple connections can be created although it is a two party communication; the user can ask to set any number of connections.
 * 
 * An application written for running a two party protocol can be the client of the Communications Layer. An example of a possible 
 * usage follows:<p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Instantiate an object of type TwoPartyCommunicationSetup.</li>
 * <li>Call the prepareForCommunication method of that object with two parties to connect to and other setup parameters.</li>
 * <li>Get from prepareForCommunication a container holding all ready connections.</li>
 * <li>Start the two party protocol.</li> 
 * <li>Call the send and receive methods of the ready connections as needed by the protocol.</li>
 * </ul>
 * The application may be interested in putting each connection in a different thread but it is up to the application to do so and not 
 * the responsibility of the Communications Layer. This provides more flexibility of use.
 * 
 * CommunicationSetup implements the org.apache.commons.exec.TimeoutObserver interface. 
 * This interface supplies a mechanism for notifying classes that a timeout has arrived.
