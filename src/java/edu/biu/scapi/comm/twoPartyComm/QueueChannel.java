/**
 * This class represents a concrete channel in the Decorator Pattern used to create Channels. This channel uses the 
 * JMS mechanism and can work on any concrete implementation, by getting a concrete Connection object in the constructor.<P>
 *  
 * The JMS mechanism provides a way of messaging. We use a peer-to-peer facility: A messaging client can send 
 * messages to, and receive messages from, any other client. 
 * Each client connects to a messaging agent that provides facilities for creating, sending, receiving, and 
 * reading messages.
 * JMS enables distributed communication that is loosely coupled. A component sends a message to a destination, 
 * and the recipient can retrieve the message from the destination. 
 * However, the sender and the receiver do not have to be available at the same time in order to communicate. 
 * In fact, the sender does not need to know anything about the receiver; nor does the receiver need to know anything 
 * about the sender. The sender and the receiver need to know only which message format and which destination to use.
 * In this respect, messaging differs from tightly coupled technologies, such as Remote Method Invocation (RMI), 
 * which require an application to know a remote applications methods.<p>
 * 
 * In order to enforce the right usage of the Channel class we will restrict the ability to instantiate one, 
 * only to classes within the Communication Layers package. This means that the constructor of the channel will be 
 * unreachable from another package. However, the send, receive and close functions will be declared public, therefore 
 * allowing anyone holding a channel to be able to use them.<p>
