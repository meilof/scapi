/**
 * This class implements a communication between multiple parties using TCP sockets.<p>
 * Each created channel contains two sockets; one is used to send messages and one to receive messages.<p>
 * This class encapsulates the stage of connecting to other parties. In actuality, the connection to other parties is 
 * performed in a few steps, which are not visible to the outside user.
 * These steps are:<p>
 * <ul> 
 * <li>For each party,</li>
 * <ul>
 * <li>For each requested channel, create an actual TCP socket with the other party. This socket is used to send messages</li>
 * </ul>
 * <li>Create a server socket that listen to all other parties calls. When a call is received, check who is the connecting party and use the created socket to receive messages from this party.</li>
 * <li>run a protocol that checks if all the necessary connections were set between my party and other parties.</li>
 * <li>In the end return to the calling application a set of connected and ready channels to be used throughout a cryptographic protocol.</li>
 * </ul>
 * From this point onwards, the application can send and receive messages in each connection as required by the protocol.<p>
