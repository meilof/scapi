/**
 * This class implements a communication between multiple parties using SSL sockets.<p>
 * It derives the {@link SocketMultipartyCommunicationSetup} class since the implementation is equal except the channel type.
 * This class creates an {@link SSLSocketChannel} while the SocketMultipartyCommunicationSetup creates a {@link PlainTCPSocketChannel}.<p>
 * 
 * In order to create an sslSocket you should have an {@link SSLContext} which should be loaded with the key store and trust store. 
 * The keyStore contains the certificate that should be sent to the other party, in SCAPI the default name is "scapiKeystore".
 * The trustStore contains the certificate that should be received from the other party, in SCAPI the default name as "scapiCacerts".
 * This loading is done once in the constructor of this class and is passed to the {@link SSLSocketMultipartyListenerThread} and to each {@link SSLSocketChannel}. 
 * This factory is used to send the certificate of this application.
