/** 
 * 
 * The CommunicationSetup class holds a container of type EstablishedConnections that keeps track of the connections (channels) 
 * as they are being established. This container has a number of channels that can be in different states.
 * EstablishedConnections has regular operations of containers such as add and remove. It also has logical operations such as areAllConnected.
 * At the end of the prepare for communication method, the calling application receives a map of connections in the EstablishedConnections 
 * object held by the CommunicationSetup. At this stage, all the channels in EstablishedConnections object need to be in READY state. 
 * It is possible that this object will be null if the prepare for communication did not succeed. 
 * The key to the map is an object of type InetSocketAddress that holds the IP and the port. Since the IP and port are unique, 
 * they define a unique InetSocketAddress that can serve as a key to the map.
