/** 
 * The CommunicationSetup class is the heart of the Communications Layer. The Communications Layer package is a tool used by a client that is interested in setting up connections 
 * between itself and other parties. As such, this layer does not initiate any independent tasks, but the opposite. Given a list of parties, it attempts to set connections to them 
 * according to parameters given by the calling application. If succeeds, it returns these connections so that the calling client can send and receive data over them.<p>
 * An application written for running an MPC protocol can be the client of the Communications Layer. An example of a possible usage follows:<p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Instantiate an object of type CommunicationSetup.</li>
 * <li>Call the prepareForCommunication method of that object with a list of parties to connect to and other setup parameters. (prepareForCommunication is the only public method of this class).</li>
 * <li>Get from prepareForCommunication a container holding all ready connections.</li>
 * <li>Start the MPC protocol.</li> 
 * <li>Call the send and receive methods of the ready connections as needed by the MPC.</li>
 * </ul>
 * The application may be interested in putting each connection in a different thread but it is up to the application to do so and not the responsibility of the Communications Layer. This provides more flexibility of use.
 * The Communications Layer encapsulates the stage of connecting to other parties. In actuality, the connection to other parties is performed in a few steps, which are not visible to the outside user.
 * These steps are:<p>
 * <ul> 
 * <li>create an actual TCP connection with each party</li>
 * <li>exchange keys between my party and other parties</li>
 * <li>run a protocol that checks (for different types of required success) if all the necessary connections were set between my party and other parties.</li>
 * </ul>
 * In the end, the Communications Layer via the CommunicationSetup class returns to the calling application, a set of connected and ready channels to be used throughout a cryptographic protocol.<br/>
 * From this point onwards, the application can send and receive messages in each connection as required by the protocol.<p>
 * CommunicationSetup implements the org.apache.commons.exec.TimeoutObserver interface. 
 * This interface supplies a mechanism for notifying classes that a timeout has arrived. 
 * 
 * This class deprecated since there are new communication implementations. A communication between two parties can be 
 * found at edu.biu.scapi.twoPartyComm package and communication between multiple parties can be found at 
 * edu.biu.scapi.multiPartyComm package.
