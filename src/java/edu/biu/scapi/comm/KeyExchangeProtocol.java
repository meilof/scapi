/**
 * Key Exchange Protocols are implemented using the Strategy design pattern so that different protocols can be chosen by the application. 
 * An instance of the chosen concrete class is passed to the CommunicationSetup. We will currently implement three options:
 *   Init key, in this protocol each party has already received as input the shared keys.
 *   Plain Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange.
 *   Universally Composable Diffie-Hellman.
 * Since Key Exchange Protocols are a type of Protocol, they also implement the Protocol Interface.
