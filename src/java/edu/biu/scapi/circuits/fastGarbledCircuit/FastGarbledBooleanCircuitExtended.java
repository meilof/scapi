/**
 * This interface is an extension for the basic fast garbled boolean circuit, FastGarbledBooleanCircuit. <p>
 * The goal was to keep the basic garbled circuit as much simple as possible, and put all the extended possibilities and features in a different interface.<p>
 * This interface should be used in the case of malicious adversaries, thus it adds some related functions. <p>
 * The most important features here are:<p>
 * 1. The ability to set the input or/and output garbled values.<p>
 * 2. The ability to sample the garbled values using a given seed.<p>
 * There are also some additional verify function that matches these features.
